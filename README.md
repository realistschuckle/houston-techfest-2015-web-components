# [Houston TechFest](http://houstontechfest-public.sharepoint.com) 2015 Web Components

## Building Web Applications with Web Components

Web Components have been on developersâ€™ radars for quite some time now. They
were first introduced by Alex Russell at Fronteers Conference 2011. The concept
shook the community up and became the topic of many future talks and
discussions.

Four years later, most people still haven't heard of Web components and how they
allow developers to extend the native Document Object Model of the browser to
create custom HTML tags with encapsulated behavior and style.

This talk will introduce you to the technology, a couple of libraries, and then
reveal the power behind Web Components in a live demonstration of building a
non-trivial application.

The code will only work in browsers that support ES6 features like classes and
arrow functions, not because Web components need that, but that's how I like
to write code: _on the cutting edge_ :)

1. Clone the repo
2. Start up a server
  * go: `go run server.go`
  * python: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`
3. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser
